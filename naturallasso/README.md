This folder contains all the codes used for the numerical studies in the paper. In particular:

- lambda_cv: contains codes (using simulator) to run simulation for all methods using cross-validation. "plot_for_paper.R" generate Figure 1 in the main paper and Figure 1 in the supplement. See the comments of the code for details.

- lambda_fixed: contains codes (using simulator) to run simulation for all methods using a pre-specified value of tuning parameter. "plot_for_paper.R" generate Figure 2 in the main paper and Figure 2 in the supplement. See the comments of the code for details.

- paired_tests.R: used to run paired tests for the significance of the performance difference among methods. It generates Table 1 in the supplement.

- MSD_study: contains code and data for Section 6 (Million Song dataset). "MSD.R" runs the numerical study, and "table_for_paper.R" generates Table 1 in the paper and Table 2 in the supplement.
